# LineScape

## Vision
- An app that uses crowd-sourcing to keep track of the capacity and occupation in certain services in UP, tracking the amount of people in line to use those services and their opening and closing schedules.

## Product Vision

- For FEUP students who don't want to wait in lines, LineScape is an app that uses crowd sourcing to tell you how big lines at FEUP are ,as well as the capacity of certain spots like the library, department bars and parking lot etc. Unlike Sigarra/uni, our product thinks beyond our academic needs.

## Features
- Canteen lines and Department Bars: Creating statistics using a like/dislike button according to the capacity and occupation of the spot.
- Parking Lot Capacity: Through crowd-sourcing, the app should be able to give the user feedback about the chance of finding an empty spot at a specific parking lot in FEUP. the app should also allow users to give their own feedback about the parking lot reacting with a Like for signaling when the parking lot has significant space and a Dislike for signaling when it has little space left for parking.
- Library Seats: The app allows users to check each floor of the library and understand which floors have more free seats and which have less, presenting each floor with a greener color the emptier it is.
- Ordering Places: The app automatically orders the places from emptier to fuller and separates them in the following categories: Library Floors, Places to Eat, Parking Lots, Theorical Classrooms and Study Rooms.
- Manage Schedule: The app gives alternatives for theorical classes, only if the statistics show the classroom is full.

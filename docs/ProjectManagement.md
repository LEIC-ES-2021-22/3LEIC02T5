# Iteration 1 - Retrospective

## Did Well

- Interface implementation was quick and the result was close to what was initially planned.
- Group organization and tasks were well-divided amongst the group.

## Do Differently

- Too much time was spent on the log-in screen when it possibly wasn't that important to implement initially.
- We should have organized ourselves a little better for the iteration end.
- We should have focused ore on testing (both automated acceptance and unit testing) and not only on implementing code.

## Puzzles

- We still need to think of how we are going to integrate our app in Uni's interface.
- There are still some things to decide about what data the app will display (only crowd-sourcing data, both crowd-sourcing and real-time data when available...)

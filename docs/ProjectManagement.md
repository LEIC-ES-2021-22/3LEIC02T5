# Iteration 1 - Retrospective

## Did Well

- Interface implementation was quick and the result was close to what was initially planned.
- Group organization and tasks were well-divided amongst the group.

## Do Differently

- Too much time was spent on the log-in screen when it possibly wasn't that important to implement initially.
- We should have organized ourselves a little better for the iteration end.
- We should have focused ore on testing (both automated acceptance and unit testing) and not only on implementing code.

## Puzzles

- We still need to think of how we are going to integrate our app in Uni's interface.
- There are still some things to decide about what data the app will display (only crowd-sourcing data, both crowd-sourcing and real-time data when available...)

# Iteration 2 - Retrospective

## Did Well

- We managed to develop more functionality in this iteration than in the previous one, focusing more on the app functioning than in its design.
- The code used to read from the Parking Lot API ended up being relatively simple and can be adapted to other API's we may need to read from in development.
- Despite not focusing so much in it, the app's interface is also relatively well designed.
- We managed to quickly make decisions about some details that weren't decided until now about the way the app works.

## Do Differently

- We should develop more tests from now on, since we are implementing the main features of the app.
- We need to be a bit quicker developing code and implementing features.

## Puzzles

- We are still a bit confused when it comes to testing, especially about the automated acceptance tests, because our app doesn't have a lot of functionality so far.
- We still need to figure out how to integrate our app inside Uni.

# Iteration 3 - Retrospective

## Did Well

- We managed to close a bigger amount of issues in this iteration.
- We delivered cleaner, simpler and more organized code in this iteration.

## Do Differently

- Some of our code could be fairly more simple if we made more use of functions to draw similar elements on a page.
- If we had another iteration, we could change the way the app is implemented so the mocks data could be read from files, as reading from those text files would make the code similar to what we would need once we had access to the back end.

## Puzzles

- We were not able to implement the Canteen API after some tries, so we implemented the menus and schedules through mocks.
- We couldn't apply web scraping to the Library Occupation Web Page (we couldn't get the JSON with the data) so we implemented the feature using sample images from the web page as mocks.
